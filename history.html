                <h2>The Origins of Impressionism <span class="reading-time">2 min read</span></h2>
                <p>
                    Impressionism emerged in France in the late 19th century as a revolutionary movement in art, challenging traditional techniques and subjects that had dominated Western painting. By rejecting the meticulous realism and historical themes prevalent in academic art, Impressionist artists sought to capture the essence of moments in everyday life. The movement was officially born in 1874, when a group of artists—later known as the Impressionists—exhibited their works independently of the prestigious Salon, the official art exhibition of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Paris.

                <p>
                    The hallmark of Impressionist art lies in its innovative approach to capturing light, atmosphere, and movement. Painters often worked en plein air, or outdoors, allowing them to observe and depict natural light and weather conditions as they changed throughout the day. They employed loose, rapid brushstrokes, which gave their work a sense of immediacy and vibrancy. Rather than focusing on intricate detail, they used color and brushwork to convey the overall feeling of a scene, often emphasizing lighter colors and shades. This approach allowed them to create the "impression" of a moment, hence the movement’s name.

                <h2>Key Figures of the Movement <span class="reading-time">3 min read</span></h2>
                <p>
                    Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas, and Camille Pissarro were among the most influential artists in the Impressionist movement. Monet, often regarded as the father of Impressionism, was famous for his series paintings, in which he captured the same scene at different times of day to explore light and color. Renoir, known for his vibrant and warm portraits, celebrated human intimacy and the joys of life. Degas, meanwhile, was fascinated by movement, particularly in ballet dancers and horse races, and his work often displayed a unique compositional approach influenced by Japanese prints. Pissarro, who is sometimes called the “dean of Impressionism,” was a mentor to many younger artists and a key organizer of the independent exhibitions.
