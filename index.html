            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Impressionism, an art movement that emerged in the late 19th century, brought a revolutionary approach to painting. Artists of this movement sought to capture fleeting moments, emphasizing light, color, and everyday scenes rather than the formal subjects that were traditionally favored. Key figures like Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Edgar Degas broke away from conventional techniques, using quick brushstrokes and vivid colors to portray the world in a new, refreshing way. Impressionism was not only about aesthetics; it challenged established art norms and inspired future movements, setting the stage for modern art.
